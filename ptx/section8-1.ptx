  <title>Conic Sections</title>
  <p>
    In your mathematical life, you have no doubt seen circles, ellipses, parabolas, and possibly even hyperbolas. Here we make precise the geometric and algebraic definitions of these objects.
    EXTRA<fn>My goal for the material on conic sections is to make them aware of and provide a taste of the link between the algebraic definitions and the geometric definitions.</fn></p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider two identical, infinitely tall, right circular cones placed vertex to vertex so that they share the same axis of symmetry (two infinite ice cream cones placed point-to-point). A <term>conic section</term> is the intersection of this three dimensional surface with any plane that does not pass through the vertex where the two cones meet.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    These intersections are called circles (when the plane is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry), parabolas (when the plane is parallel to one side of one cone), hyperbolas (when the plane is parallel to the axis of symmetry), and ellipses (when the plane does not meet any of the three previous criteria). This is a geometric interpretation of the conic sections, but each conic sections may also be represented by a quadratic equation in two variables.

    <statement>
      <p>
        <em>Algebraically.</em> Graph the set of all points <m>(x,y)</m> in the plane satisfying <m>Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0</m> where:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>A=B=C=0</m> ,<m>D = 1</m>, <m>E = 2</m> and <m>F = 3</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>A=1/16</m>, <m>C=1/9</m>, <m>B=D=E=0</m> and <m>F=-1</m>.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>

  <p>
    Every conic section may be obtained by making appropriate choices for <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>, <m>D</m>, <m>E</m>, and <m>F</m>. Now let's return to the definition you might have seen in high school for a circle.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Given a plane, a point <m>(h,k)</m> in the plane, and a positive number <m>r,</m> the {{circle}} with <term>center</term> <m>(h,k)</m> and <term>radius</term> <m>r</m> is the set of all points in the plane at a distance <m>r</m> from <m>(h,k)</m>.

        the plane <m>Q</m> so that <m>d(P,Q) = d(Q,L).</m> The point <m>P</m> is called the <term>focus</term> of the parabola and the line <m>L</m> is called the {{directrix}} of the parabola.
