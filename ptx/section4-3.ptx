  <title>Graphing</title>
  <p>
    Prior to an understanding of derivatives, graphing was largely a matter of:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          plotting points,
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          memorizing the basic shapes of certain types of functions, and
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          trusting the graphs generated by technology.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    With algebra and differentiation at our disposal, we can make a precise science out of graphing that will give more information than even our graphing software yields.
    EXTRA<fn>Graphing was such a revelation to me when I first saw it that I like to give serious attention to graphing of some non-trivial problems.  There are some challenging ones in this section and more challenging ones in the practice problems.  It is not uncommon for me to give a choice of two or three problems and have students turn in a full graph, listing everything they can and explaining all the mathematics behind how they found the information related to the graph.  This may serve as a presentation grade or as points added to a test.</fn></p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        I will work a few of these examples to provide intuition for the upcoming definitions.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>p(x) = x^4-13x^2+36</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\dsp q(x)=\frac{3}{x^2+1}</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f(x) = 2x^{5/3}-5x^{4/3}</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\dsp r(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{2x+1}</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\dsp F(t)=t^{2/3}-3</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\dsp h(x)=\frac{3x^2}{x^{2}+1}</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    We list several questions that you should ask when graphing a function.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Question 1.</em> What are the intercepts and asymptotes of the function?
  </p>

  <p>
    Recall that an <m>x</m>-intercept is a point where the function crosses the <m>x</m>-axis (i.e. <m>y=0</m>) and a <m>y</m>-intercept is a point where the function crosses the <m>y</m>-axis (i.e. <m>x=0</m>).
  </p>

  <p>
    Recall that asymptotes (<xref ref="asymptote">Definition</xref>) are functions (usually lines) that <m>f</m> approaches. Limits are helpful in understanding and locating asymptotes. Review <xref ref="hor">Problem</xref> and <xref ref="vert">Problem</xref> when studying asymptotes.
  </p>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        List any intercepts and asymptotes for:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\dsp f(x) = \frac{x}{(x-2)(x+3)}</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>E(x) = 3-e^{-x}</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\dsp g(x) = \frac{3x}{\sqrt{x^2+3}}</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    <em>Question 2.</em> What are the local maxima and minima of the function?
  </p>

  <p>
    The peaks and the valleys are called local maxima and local minima, respectively.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If f is a function, then we say that the point <m>(c,f(c))</m> is a <term>local maximum</term> for f if there is some interval, (a,b), containing c so that <m>f(x) \lt  f(c)</m> for all <m>x \in (a,b)</m> except <m>x=c.</m> Local minimum is defined similarly.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    We have seen examples of local minima and maxima. <xref ref="absolutederiv">Problem</xref> had a minimum at a point where the derivative did not exist. In <xref ref="l26">problem</xref> we found the local maxima and minima by finding the points where the tangent lines were horizontal. Hence points on the graph where the derivative is either zero or undefined are important points.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f</m> is a function, then any value <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m> where <m>f'(x)</m> is zero or undefined is called a <term>critical value</term> of <m>f</m>. We refer to <m>(x,f(x))</m> as a <term>critical point</term> of <m>f.</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Critical points give us candidates for local maximum or minimum, but they do not guarantee a maximum of minimum. The function <m>f(x) = x^3 + 2</m> has <m>(0,2)</m> as a critical point, but this point is neither a minimum nor a maximum.
  </p>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find the critical values for these functions.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>g(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 12x</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f(x) = \sin(2x)</m> on <m>[0,2\pi]</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>s(x) = (x-3)^{1/3}</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    <em>Question 3.</em> Where is the function increasing? Decreasing?
  </p>

  <p>
    Determining where a function is increasing or decreasing is perhaps the most useful graphing tool, so we'll call it <em>the Fundamental Theorem of Graphing.</em>
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We say that a function <m>f</m> is <term>increasing</term> if, for every pair of numbers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in the domain of <m>f</m> with <m>x\lt y</m>, we have <m>f(x) \lt  f(y).</m> Decreasing, non-increasing, and non-decreasing are defined similarly.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    If the slopes of all tangent lines to the function <m>f</m> are positive over an interval <m>(a,b)</m>, then <m>f</m> is increasing on the interval <m>(a,b)</m> and if the slopes of all tangent lines to the function <m>f</m> are negative over an interval <m>(a,b)</m>, then <m>f</m> is decreasing on the interval <m>(a,b)</m>.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <em>The Fundamental Theorem of Graphing.</em> If <m>f</m> is a function and is differentiable on the interval <m>(a,b)</m> and <m>f'(x) > 0</m> for all <m>x</m> in <m>(a,b)</m>, then <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>(a,b)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        These are the functions you found the critical values for in the last problem. List the intervals on which these functions are increasing by finding where <m>f'>0</m>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>g(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 12x</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f(x) = \sin(2x)</m> on <m>[0,2\pi]</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    <em>Question 4.</em> Where is the function concave up? Concave down?
  </p>

  <p>
    Sketch <m>f(x) = x^3-x.</m> The graph of <m>f</m> looks somewhat like a parabola opening downward on the interval <m>(-\infty, 0)</m> and somewhat like a parabola opening upward on the interval <m>(0,\infty)</m>. We say that <m>f</m> is <em>concave down</em> on <m>(-\infty, 0)</m> and <em>concave up</em> on <m>(0,\infty)</m>. The defining characteristic for concavity is that <m>f</m> is concave down when the slopes of the tangent lines are decreasing and <m>f</m> is concave up when the slopes are increasing.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We say that <m>f</m> is <term>concave up</term> on <m>(a,b)</m> if <m>f'</m> is increasing on <m>(a,b)</m> and <term>concave down</term> on <m>(a,b)</m> if <m>f'</m> is decreasing on <m>(a,b)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Applying the <em>Fundamental Theorem of Graphing</em>, <m>f</m> will be concave up when <m>f'</m> is increasing which will be when <m>f''</m> is positive.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Question 5.</em> What are the inflection points for the function?
  </p>

  <p>
    Inflection points are points on the curve in which the function switches either from concave up to concave down, or from concave down to concave up.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We say that <m>(x,f(x))</m> is an <term>inflection point</term> for <m>f</m> if the concavity of <m>f</m> changes sign at <m>x.</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\dsp f(x) = \frac{6}{x^2+3}</m>. Find the values where <m>f''=0</m>. Find the intervals where <m>f</m> is concave up. List the inflection points.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    <em>Question 6.</em> What is the least upper bound of the function? The greatest lower bound?
  </p>

  <p>
    From the graph of <m>\dsp f(x) = \frac{6}{x^2+1}</m> in the last problem we see that <m>(0,6)</m> is the highest point on the graph, but there is no lowest point since the graph looks like an infinite bell <mdash /> it tends towards zero as <m>x</m> takes on large positive or large negative values. We say that 6 is the <em>least upper bound of</em> <m>f</m> and that <m>f</m> <em>attains this value</em> since <m>f(0)=6.</m> We say that <m>0</m> is the <em>greatest lower bound</em> and that <m>f</m> <em>does not attain this value</em> since there is no number <m>x</m> so that <m>f(x) = 0.</m>
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If there is a number <m>M</m> satisfying <m>f(x) \leq M</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>, then we call <m>M</m> an <term>upper bound</term> of <m>f.</m> If there is no number less than <m>M</m> that satisfies this property, then we call <m>M</m> the <term>least upper bound</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For each function (1) find the least upper bound or state why it does not exist, and (2) find the greatest lower bound or state why it does not exist.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>E(x) = 3-e^{-x}</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>

        Choose {one} of the functions below and attempt to list as much information as possible. Use this information to help you sketch a very precise graph of the function.
