  <title>Tangent Lines</title>
  <p>
    We are going to define <em>tangent line</em> from a physical point-of-view rather than
    give a rigorous mathematical definition. Sketch any function, <m>f</m>, and pick a point on it. Label
    your point <m>(a,f(a)).</m> Place your pencil on the graph at a point to the left of <m>(a,f(a)).</m> Imagine that
    your pencil is a car, the graph is a road, and you are driving toward the point <m>(a,f(a))</m> from the left.
    Suppose that there is a perfectly frictionless patch of ice at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m> and keep
    drawing in the direction the car would travel as it slides off the road. Now do the same from the right.
    If the two lines you drew form a line, then you have drawn the
    <em>tangent line to <m>f</m> at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m></em>. If they don't form a line,
    then <m>f</m> does not have a tangent line at this point.

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>secant line</term> for the graph <m>f</m> is a line passing through two points on the graph of <m>f.</m>

  <problem>
    <statement>

          <li>
            <p>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(2,f(2))</m> and <m>(2.5,f(2.5))</m>
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(2,f(2))</m> and <m>(2.1,f(2.1))</m>
