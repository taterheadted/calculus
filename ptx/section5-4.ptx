    Integration has many applications in all the sciences. Here are a few we will consider. Integration can be used to find the length of a curve. Integration can be used to find the area between two curves, which is useful for computing the area of an oil spill as photographed from a plane. It can be used to derive the formulas for the volumes of objects like cones and to determine the volumes of other less ordinary objects. It can be used to find the work done in stretching a spring or pumping water out of an oil well. The key to all these problems is to first approximate the solution using a Riemann sum and then to take the limit as the number of divisions tends to infinity in order to obtain an integral that solves the problem. Restated, the key is the definition of the definite integral,
    <me>
      \dsp \int_a^b f(x) \ \ dx = \lim_{N \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i) (x_i - x_{i-1}).

    <em>Area Between Curves</em>
    EXTRA<fn>Being on the Gulf Coast, I motivate the area between curves by drawing an oil spill on the board and asking how we might find the volume of this spill in order to determine what supplies our emergency management team needs to send.   Students generate good ideas <mdash /> digitize a photo or place a grid of lines over it and count the squares.  I foreshadow the notion of using interpolation to approximate the <q>top</q> of the spill with a function <m>f</m> and the <q>bottom</q> of the spill with a function <m>g</m> and then point out that the area of the spill would be the <m>\int_a^b f(x) \ dx - \int_a^b g(x) \ dx</m>, and the volume would be the thickness of the spill times this area.   My goal in such applied discussions is that by foreshadowing numerical mathematics such as finding functions that approximate a set of points,  I will pique their interest in future classes.</fn></p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Discuss using area between curves to approximate the volume of an oil spill, followed by computing the area between <m>y=x^2+1</m> and <m>y=2x+1</m> by adding up the areas of rectangles to define an integral, thus illustrating the central theme of the section.

    Every one who rides a skateboard knows that you can scrub speed off by slaloming back and forth as you proceed down a hill. In doing so, you travel a greater distance than the speed freak who takes a straight line.

    <em>Work and Force</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Hooke's Law</em> states that if a spring with force constant <m>k</m> is stretched a distance of <m>x</m> units, then the spring will exert a force of <m>F(x) = -kx</m>. The constant <m>k</m> is measured in either Newtons/meter or pounds/foot depending on whether we are using the metric or English system. The <em>work</em> done by a force acting on an object is defined to be force times the distance traveled (displacement).
  </p>

    <em>Newton's Second Law of Motion</em> states that force equals mass times acceleration, <m>F=ma</m>. In the SI system the density of water is 1000 kg/<m>{{m^3}}</m> and the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/<m>{{sec^2}}</m>. Therefore the weight of 1 <m>{{m^3}}</m> of water =(1000)(9.81) N/<m>{{m^3}}</m> = 9810 N/<m>{{m^3}}</m>. In the British system, the density of water is 1.94 slugs/<m>{{ft^3}}</m> and the acceleration due to gravity is 32.2 ft/<m>{{sec^2}}</m>. Therefore the weight of water is approximately 62.5 lb/<m>{{ft^3}}</m>.

    <em>Volumes of Solids</em>
    EXTRA<fn>I confess to having skipped this section many semesters when time was tight, even though I really enjoyed and gained a lot from it as a student.</fn></p>

  <p>
    We now develop a technique that will allow us to compute volumes of various three dimensional objects. A <em>solid</em> is a three dimensional object along with its interior; think bowling ball, not balloon. When we computed areas, we began with Riemann sums to approximate the area and as the number of rectangles tended to infinity, the integral expression turned out to be nothing more than integrating over the height of the function at each point. That is,
    <me>
      \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) (x_i - x_{i-1}) = \int_a^b f(x) \ dx.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus what we integrated was simply the height of the line segment from <m>(x,0)</m> to <m>(x,f(x))</m>. Intuitively, we might think of this as adding up infinitely many line lengths to get the area. Of course, the only <em>mathematically valid</em> way to think of this is as the limit of sums of areas of rectangles. The same idea applies to solids. To be precise, we need to slice the volume into <m>n</m> pieces and sum the volumes of each of the <m>n</m> pieces. Then we would take the limit as <m>n \to \infty.</m> Intuitively, we might think of slicing the solid into infinitely many cross sections and adding up the area of all these cross sections. The volume of a solid is the integral of the function that tells us the area of each cross section. Let's call this the <em>method of slicing</em>.

  </problem>

  <p>
    The method of slicing can be used to find the volumes of <em>surfaces of revolution</em> which are solids created by taking a two dimensional region (an area) and rotating this region about a line to form a three dimensional solid. For example, take the unit circle and spin it about the <m>x</m>-axis and you get a sphere along with its interior. Or, take a circle of radius one centered at (2,0) and spin it around the <m>y</m>-axis and you get a donut.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find the volume obtained by rotating the region bounded by <m>f(x) = x^3-x</m> and <m>y=0</m> about the x-axis.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    Sketching this, we get two solids. Looking at the portion where <m>x>0</m>, we see something shaped like a lime with ends at <m>(0,0)</m> and <m>(1,0)</m>. Choose a value for <m>x</m> between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>. If we think about slicing the lime parallel to the <m>y</m>-axis and through the point <m>(x,0)</m>, then the cross section (slice) will be a circle and the area of this circle is <m>A = \pi r^2 = \pi (f(x))^2</m> since the radius of the circle is <m>f(x).</m> Therefore by the method of slicing, the volume of the solid <m>S</m> is given by
    <me>
      V = \pi \int_a ^b [f(x)]^2 \; dx.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    This method of finding the volume of revolution is called the <em>disk method</em> since intuitively we are adding up the area of an infinite number of disks.
  </p>

    Now that we know this method of slicing up the surfaces, one might ask <q>Is this the only way we can slice up the surface to find the volume?</q> The answer is that there are lots of ways to slice up the surfaces. Let's look at another way.
  </p>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find the volume obtained by rotating the region bounded by <m>f(x) = x-x^4</m> and the x-axis about the x-axis.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find the volume obtained by rotating around the y-axis the region bounded by <m>f(x) = x-x^4</m> and the x-axis.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    To use the disk method, we would need to rewrite the function <m>f</m> which has as its independent variable, <m>x</m>, as a function <m>g</m> which has as its independent variable, <m>y.</m> Go ahead and try <mdash /> if you can, you can skip the rest of this section! If you can't, read on!
  </p>

  <p>
    We will still be using the method of slicing, but we will use a <q>circular knife</q> like a cookie cutter so that instead of circular slices, we will have cylindrical slices. We will add up the surface area of each cylindrical slice, just as before we added up the areas of each circular slice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Choose a value <m>x</m> between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m> and draw the line segment from <m>(x,0)</m> to <m>(x,f(x)).</m> Now rotate this line about the y-axis. Do you see that this is a <q>cylindrical slice</q> of your solid? If we consider all such slices with <m>x</m> ranging from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m>, then integrating the function that gives the surface area of each slice will (again) yield the volume of our solid. But what exactly is the surface area of our slice? The radius of the cylinder is <m>x</m> and the height is <m>f(x)</m> so the area must be <m>A(x) = 2 \pi x f(x).</m> And the volume will be the integral of this quantity,
    <me>
      V = 2 \pi \int_0 ^1 x f(x) \; dx = 2 \pi \int_0 ^1 x (x-x^4) \; dx = \frac{\pi}{3}.
    </me>

    This method is called the {{shell method}} or the <em>cylindrical shell method</em>.
