  <p>
    At this point we have used the definition of the derivative (limits) to compute the derivatives
    of many different functions, including: <m>a</m> (constant function), <m>x</m> (the identity function), <m>x^2</m>, <m>x^3</m>, <m>4x^3</m>, <m>x^4</m>, <m>\dsp \sqrt{x+1}</m>, <m>2x^3 + 3x^2 - 7</m>, <m>\dsp \frac{1}{x}</m>, <m>\dsp \frac{1}{x+1}</m>, <m>\dsp \frac{x-5}{x+2}</m>, <m>|x-2|</m>, and <m>x^3 + 2</m>. Based on the derivatives we have computed thus far, you can likely guess the answer to the next question.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Question.</em> What is the derivative of <m>f(x) = x^{200}</m>?  <em>Guess.</em> <m>f'(x)=200x^{199}</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    How do we <em>know</em> if our guess is correct? We don't. We must show that it is true using the
    definition of the derivative. Rather than work this one problem and still not know what the derivative
    of <m>g(x) = x^{201}</m> is, we'll let <m>n</m> represent some unknown natural number and compute the derivative of
    <m>f(x) = x^n.</m> Because we will not choose a specific value for <m>n,</m> we will now <em>know</em> the derivative
    of an entire class of functions.

Having introduced both definitions doubles the odds that a student has success, since if they don't see how to simplify one expression, they might still see how to simplify the other.  I have seen students discover the pattern for the long division <m>\dsp \frac{x^n - t^n}{x-t}</m> and I have seen students recognize that even though they couldn't figure out the coefficients for what you and I know as the binomial theorem, they did not need the coefficients because the terms for which they did not know the coefficients tended to zero anyway!

    Since the derivative of a function is itself a function, there is no reason not to take the derivative of the derivative. When this is done, the new function is called the <em>second derivative</em> and is denoted by <m>f''</m>. Similarly the <em>third derivative</em> is denoted by <m>f'''</m>.

    You have solved <em>algebraic</em> equations such as
    <me>
      5x + 2 = 3x + 4 \;\;\; \mbox{or}  \;\;\; 3x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0
    </me>
    where the goal is to find each value of <m>x</m> that solves the equations. Engineering applications often need to solve <em> differential</em> equations such as
    <me>
      f'(x) = x f(x) \;\;\; \mbox{or}  \;\;\; f''(x) = x^3 \;\;\; \mbox{or}  \;\;\; f''(x) + f(x) = 0
    </me>
    where the goal is to find each function <m>f</m> that satisfies the equation. In the real world, solutions to differential equations might represent the shape of an airplane wing or the temperature distribution of an engine block.
    EXTRA<fn>I am regularly discussing the link between the mathematics we are doing, which may seem abstract, and the engineering applications that they will see in future courses. At the same time, I am encouraging them to take the upper-division courses in differential equations, numerical methods, foundations and analysis to strengthen their mathematics.  I give specific examples of engineers who graduated with a second degree in mathematics and had starting salaries averaging <dollar />20,000 more than the average starting salary of the engineers without the degree.  Mathematics pays because so few are good at it and if they are good at it, they should develop and exploit that skill.  Of course, some simply decide that they like the math more than the engineering and come over from the dark side.</fn></p>

    We have been very careful up to this point in the book to write the equations in <em>functional</em> notation. That is, we never wrote, <m>y=x^2,</m> but rather wrote <m>f(x) = x^2</m> to <em>emphasize</em> that <m>f</m> is the function and it depends on the <em>independent</em> variable, <m>x.</m> As you will see in other courses, it is very common to write, <m>y=x^2</m> and then follow this with <m>y'=2x.</m> Differential equations are almost always written in this short-hand, omitting the independent variable where possible, and from this point forward, we too will use this short-hand on occasion.

    <em>Algebra Reminder.</em> Any point where a function crosses the x-axis is called an <em>x-intercept</em> of the function, and any point where a function crosses the y-axis is called a <em>y-intercept</em> of the function.
