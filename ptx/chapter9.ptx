      <q>The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.</q> - Arthur C. Clarke

    <p>
      Welcome to calculus in three dimensions. The beauty of this material is how closely it parallels your first semester of calculus. After a brief introduction to the coordinate plane, you learned how to graph lines and parabolas. After a brief introduction to three-space, we will be graphing planes and paraboloids. Just as we defined continuity in terms of limits in Calculus I, we will define continuity of functions of several variables in terms of limits in this course. Lines were important as they allowed you to define tangent lines to functions and the derivative. Tangent planes to functions and surfaces will aid our definition of derivative. Once you understood the derivative, you used it to find maxima and minima of real valued functions and we will use the derivative of functions in three-space to find maxima and minima in our applications as well. Two of the most central ideas of your first calculus course were the chain rule and the fundamental theorem of calculus. We will extend your notion of the chain rule and the fundamental theorem in this course. Only near the end of the course will the work we do not have a parallel to your first course. At the end, we'll cover Green's and Gauss' Theorems, which are necessary tools in physics and engineering, but which had no parallel in Calculus I.
      EXTRA<fn>On the first day of Calculus III, we define vector addition, scalar multiplication, points in <m>\re^3</m> and vectors in <m>\re^3</m>, just as they are defined below. We then give a parametric equation for a circle and discuss how we might write <m>y=x^2</m> (or any other function) as a parametric curve in one or more ways. Then we give two points in the plane, ask the students to create a parametric equation for the line between two points and have one or more students place their (hopefully different) solutions on the board.  We discuss whether they are correct and how different equations may produce the same set of points.  Once this is done, I have them convert the parameterized lines to slope-intercept form.  This takes the entire first period and gets several students to the board in a relaxed setting, which is my primary goal for the first day.  I send them home to read the notes and start working the problems for presentation on the next day, promising that I'll post a syllabus soon.  Because we use a web site for all communication with the class, that is where I'll post the course notes, syllabus, and other details.</fn></p>

      We will also use the notation, <q><m>\in</m>,</q> to mean <q>is an element of.</q> Thus, <q><m>x \in \re</m></q> means <q><m>x</m> is an element of <m>\re,</m></q> or <q>x is a real number.</q> Similarly, <m>x,y \in \re</m> means <q>x and y are real numbers.</q> In Calculus I and II, you lived in two-space, or <m>\re^2 = \{ (x,y) : x,y \in \re \}.</m> Now you have graduated to 3-space!

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Three dimensional space (Euclidean 3-space or <m>{\re} ^3</m>), is the set of all ordered sequences of 3 real numbers. That is
          <me>
            {\re}^3\ =\ \{(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}):x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3} \in {\re}\}.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Of course, there is no reason to stop with the number 3. More generally, <m>n</m>-space or <m>\re^n</m> is the set of all ordered
      sequences of <m>n</m> real numbers, but we will spend most of our time concerned with only <m>\re, \re^2, \re^3,</m> and occasionally, <m>\re^4.</m> Euclidean 4-space is handy since one might want to consider an object or shape in 3-space that is moving with respect to time, thus adding a <m>4^{th}</m> dimension.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will write elements in <m>\re^3</m> just as letters; hence, by <m>x \in \re^3</m> we mean the element, <m>x = (x_1, x_2, x_3)</m> where <m>x_1,x_2,x_3 \in \re.</m> The <em>origin</em> is the element, <m>o = (0,0,0).</m>
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>x, y \in {\re}^3</m>, then <m>\oa{xy}</m> is the directed line segment from <m>x</m> to <m>y.</m> We abbreviate <m>\oa {ox}</m> by <m>\oa x.</m> Directed line segments are referred to as <term>vectors</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Physicists and mathematicians often speak of a vector's <em>magnitude</em> and <em>direction</em>. Given a vector, <m>\oa x,</m> by <em>magnitude (or norm)</em> we mean the distance between the point, <m>x,</m> and the origin, <m>o</m>. By <em>direction</em> we mean the direction determined by the directed line segment <m>\oa x</m> that has base at <m>o</m> and tip at the point, <m>x.</m> When we say to <q>sketch the vector <m>\oa x</m></q> we mean to draw the directed line segment from the origin to the point, <m>x.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      We are making a distinction between <em>points</em> and <em>vectors</em>. Points are the actual elements of 3-space and vectors are directed line segments. The word <em>scalar</em> will be used to refer to real numbers (and later in your mathematical career as complex numbers or elements of any field). The word, <em>point</em> may be used to mean a real number, an element of <m>\re^2</m>, an element of <m>\re^3,</m> etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having carefully made clear the distinction between <em>point</em> and <em>vector</em> you will have to work hard to keep me honest; I tend to use the two more or less interchangeably.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>x, y \in \re^3,</m> with <m>x =(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3})</m> and <m>y=(y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3})</m>, and <m>\alpha \in {\re}</m> then:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>x+y=(x_{1}+y_{1},\  x_{2}+y_{2},\  x_{3}+y_{3})</m>  <q>Addition in <m>\re^3</m></q>
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\alpha x= (\alpha x_{1},\ \alpha x_{2},\  \alpha x_{3})</m>  <q>Scalar Multiplication in <m>\re^3</m></q>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Now, to be precise, we should also define <em>vector addition</em> and <em>scalar multiplication for vectors</em>. Since the definition is identical (except for placing arrows above the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>) we omit this. As you can see, always making a distinction between a <em>point</em> and a <em>vector</em> can be cumbersome.

      Consider the two vectors, <m>\oa {xy}</m> and <m>\oa y - \oa x.</m> Both vectors have the same direction and the same magnitude.

      We will be concerned primarily with vector valued functions where the range is <m>\re^2</m> or <m>\re^3.</m> If <m>n=2</m>, then such functions are also called <em>planar curves</em> and if <m>n=3</m> they are called <em>space curves</em>.

    <p>
      In Calculus I and II you studied functions from <m>\re</m> to <m>\re,</m> for example <m>f(x)=x^3,</m> and functions from <m>\re</m> to <m>{\re}^2,</m> for example <m>\oa r(t)=(\cos(t),\sin(t))</m>. Now we have added functions from <m>{\re}</m> to <m>{\re}^3</m> such as the examples in the previous few problems. We wish to add functions from <m>\re^2</m> to <m>\re</m> to our list next. Such functions are called <em>real-valued functions of several variables.</em>
      EXTRA<fn>Here we discuss the domains and ranges of various <q>types</q> of functions including examples of all the types of function we have seen such as functions from <m>\re \rightarrow \re</m>, from <m>\re^2 \rightarrow \re</m>, from <m>\re \rightarrow \re^2</m>.  We discuss the coordinate planes, <m>x=0</m>, <m>y=0</m>, and <m>z=0</m> along with translations of these planes such as <m>x=1</m>, <m>z=3</m>, and <m>y=-4</m>. Then we graph <m>f(x,y) = 2x + y^2</m> by graphing the slices <m>x=-2</m>, <m>x=0</m>, <m>x=2</m>, and <m>y=0</m>. We'll note that this might be written as <m>z - 2x - y^2 = 0</m> which really means the set, <m>\dsp \{ (x,y,z) \in \re^3 : z - 2x - y^2 = 0 \}</m>.  I try to be very precise when I lecture, demonstrating the independent variables and writing things out completely. We compose this function with <m>l(t) = (0,0) + (1,1)t</m> and discuss that at any time <m>t</m>, a bug standing at position <m>l(t)</m> might see her friend directly above (or below) her at height, <m>f(l(t))</m> and position <m>(t,f(l(t)))</m>.  Such discussions are my attempt at giving a conceptual intuition to the many types of functions and surfaces that will arise throughout the course. Because most of my students are engineers who will see ample applications, we don't spend lots of time assigning <q>real-world</q> applications.  We do spend  time discussing the types of real-world problems to which the mathematics we do can be applied.</fn></p>

          Find two vectors orthogonal to both <m>\oa{(1,4,3)}</m> and <m>\oa{(2,-3,4)}</m>. Sketch all four vectors. EXTRA<fn>Because we allow students to look at other materials, it is common for a student to find a vector orthogonal to two vectors by using the cross product which we have not developed yet. Typically, they compute the determinant of the <q>matrix</q> with rows <m>(\oa{i}, \oa{j}, \oa{k})</m>, <m>\oa{u}</m>, and <m>\oa{v}</m>. When this happens, we use the problem as an opportunity to show  the class how to compute determinants of 2x2 and 3x3 matrices.  Some of my students have had linear algebra, but many have not.  Next we set up the equations one would need to solve in order to demonstrate how the previous problem could be worked  by brute force.  And I say that while we can use this trick, we won't know (as mathematicians) that it is valid until we resolve <xref ref="cross">Problem</xref> that shows how to find a vector perpendicular to two vectors.  The key point is that in defining the cross product to be the vector orthogonal to <m>\oa u</m> and orthogonal to <m>\oa v</m> with length the area of the  parallelogram with sides <m>\oa u</m> and <m>\oa v</m> is more or less an arbitrary choice to force a unique solution. We could have chosen any reasonable third condition (rather than the area of the parallelogram) to guarantee a unique solution.  I'm  attempting to tie together the fundamental ideas of linear algebra with the problem of finding a vector orthogonal to <m>\oa{u}</m> and <m>\oa{v}</m>.


          Around this point in the course, we expand on the meaning of the dot product by showing that if <m>\oa x</m> and <m>\oa y</m> are vectors and <m>\oa y</m> has unit length, then <m>\oa x \cdot \oa y</m> is the length of the projection of <m>\oa x</m> onto <m>\oa y</m> by using <m>\oa x \cdot \oa y = |\oa x| |\oa y| \cos{\theta}</m> and <m>\cos{\theta} = opp/hyp</m>. We do the same computation where <m>\oa y</m> is not a unit vector.  The point is that the dot product has an important meaning associated with projections.  We will use this very important fact in demonstrating how a vector line integral is used to compute the work in moving a particle through a vector field as well as with Green's Theorem and Gauss' Divergence Theorem.  I attempt to make every fact that we study early in the course a recurring theme throughout the course and we attempt to relate it to other subjects.  Of course projections, cross products, and determinants in this setting are powerful motivations for a deep understanding of linear algebra.  If they have taken linear, then it is an argument for taking the second semester; if not, it is a basis for understanding the first semester.</fn></p>

          EXTRA<fn>Here a discussion arose about the difference between a surface and a function. I told them that a surface is a two dimensional topological manifold; unfortunately, three out of four of those words are beyond the scope of the course <mdash />  take topology! I told them to think of a surface as a set of points in three-space where at every point one could place a tangent plane; think smooth and differentiable. We are most interested in being sure we understand when a given set of  points in three-space is a function.  Backing up to two-space, we discussed the example of a circle in the plane as an <em>equation</em> that is not a <em>function</em>, re-emphasizing that <m>x^2 + y^2 = 4</m> means <m>\dsp \{ (x,y) \in \re^2 : x^2 + y^2 = 4 \}</m>.  We observe that if we have an equation in three variables, <m>x</m>,<m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> such as <m>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9</m> then solving for <m>z</m> may or may not result in a function, just as solving the circle <m>x^2+y^2=9</m> for <m>y</m> does not yield a function.  Of course, we know of (and sketch) other examples of surfaces by considering <m>x^2+y^2=9</m> and <m>2x-3y=5</m> in three-space as cylinders and planes that are not functions.</fn></p>

      In the next problem the notation, <m>| \cdot |,</m> is used for both the absolute value (on the left side of the equation) and the norm (on the right side of the equation). Is this bad notation? Consider the definition for the norm, that
      <me>
        | (x_1, x_2) | = \sqrt{ x_1^2 + x_2^2}.
      </me>

    <p>
