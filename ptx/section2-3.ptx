  <title>Instantaneous Velocity and Growth Rate</title>
  <p>
    If you have been struggling, relax. This is where it all comes together.
    EXTRA<fn>Having encouraged them to be patient and that the big picture will emerge soon, this section is where the idea of instantaneous rates of change begins to gel as they see the commonality between the problems associated with computing velocity, plant growth rate, population growth rate and later slope.</fn></p>

        Experimental data indicates that on January 1, the leaf is 8.37 centimeters long and it grows at the rate of 0.18 centimeters per month for 3.5 months. From that time on, the leaf grows at a rate of 0.12 centimeters per month until it reaches a length of 9.6 centimeters. Determine the average growth rate for the whole time period.

    At this point, you know how to compute average velocity, average growth rate, instantaneous velocity, and instantaneous growth rate. You don't want to create a limit table every time you want the instantaneous velocity, so we want a function for Robbie's velocity. That is, we want a function that takes <em>time</em> as input and produces Robbie's <em>velocity</em> as output. Similarly, we want a function that takes <em>time</em> as input and produces the <em>robot population growth rate</em> as output.
