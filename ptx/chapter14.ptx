      The phrases <em>scalar field</em> and <em>vector field</em> are new to us, but the concept is not. A scalar field is simply a function whose range consists of real numbers (<em>a real-valued function</em>) and a vector field is a function whose range consists of vectors (<em>a vector-valued function</em>).
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>f(x,y) = x^2 -2xy</m> is a <em>scalar field</em>. <m>f(x,\ y)=(2x,\ 3y)</m> is a <em>vector field</em> on <m>{\re}^2</m> and <m>f(x,\ y,\ z)=(2x-y,\ y\cos(z^2),\ x-yz)</m> is a <em>vector field</em> on <m>{\re}^3</m>. For the point in the ocean at location <m>(x,y,z)</m>, the vector field <m>\oa f(x,y,z) = \big(p(x,y,z),q(x,y,z),r(x,y,z)\big)</m> might represent the direction of the current at this point where <m>p,q,r: \re^n \to \re.</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n</m> and <m>m</m> be integers greater than or equal to 2. A <term>scalar field</term> on <m>{\re}^n</m> is a function <m>f:{\re^n}\to{\re}</m>. A <term>vector field</term> on <m>{\re}^n</m> is a function <m>f:{\re}^n\to{\re}^n.</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      We now modify our definition for <m>\nabla</m>. If <m>f: \re^2 \to \re</m>, then we previously defined <m>\dsp \nabla f = (f_x, f_y) = (\frac{ \partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{ \partial f}{\partial y}).</m> We now redefine <m>\nabla</m> as an <em>operator</em> that acts on the set of differentiable functions and write
      <me>
        \nabla = \left(\frac{ \partial }{\partial x}, \frac{ \partial }{\partial y}\right).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      This encompasses our previous notation as we may now write
      <me>
        \dsp \nabla f = \big(\frac{ \partial }{\partial x}, \frac{ \partial }{\partial y}\big)(f)= \big(\frac{ \partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{ \partial f}{\partial y}\big)= (f_x, f_y).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      We previously defined the dot product only between vectors (and points) in <m>\re^n</m> and now redefine that notation as well. If <m>\oa f: \re^2 \to  \re^2</m> and <m>\oa f(x,y) = \left(p(x,y),q(x,y)\right)</m>, then we will write
      <me>
        \nabla \cdot \oa f = \left(\frac{ \partial }{\partial x}, \frac{ \partial }{\partial y}\right) \cdot \big(p(x,y),q(x,y)\big) = \frac{ \partial p }{\partial x} + \frac{ \partial q }{\partial y} = p_x(x,y) + q_y(x,y).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      The next definition formalizes what we just wrote, stating it for <m>\re^3</m>.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\oa f(x,y,z)  = \Big(p(x,y,z) ,q(x,y,z) ,r(x,y,z) \Big): {\re}^3\to {\re}^3</m> is a differentiable vector field, then the <term>divergence of <m>\oa{f}</m></term> is the scalar field from <m>{\re}^3\to {\re}</m> defined by: <m>\nabla \cdot \oa{f}=p_x + q_y + r_z</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

    <p>
      The divergence of a function at a point is the tendency for fluid to move away from or toward that point, where a positive divergence indicates fluid is moving away from the point and a negative divergence indicates that fluid is moving toward the point.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Sketch the vector fields, <m>F(x,y) = (x,y)</m> and <m>F(x,y) = (-x,y)</m> and compute the divergence of each.
          EXTRA<fn>Discuss vector fields such as gravity and how the work done along any path will be equal.   Discuss another field such as river flow where if it is all flowing downstream it is conservative, but if there is an eddy in the middle, then two paths across the river may result in differing amounts of work.</fn></p>

      The next definition extends our definition of the cross product, <m>\times.</m>
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\oa f(x,y,z)  = (p(x,y,z) ,q(x,y,z) ,r(x,y,z) ) : \re^3 \to \re^3</m>, then the <term>curl</term> of <m>\oa f</m> denoted by <m>\nabla \times f</m> is defined by the vector valued function
          <me>
            \nabla \times \oa f = \left(\frac{ \partial }{\partial x}, \frac{ \partial }{\partial y}, \frac{ \partial }{\partial z}\right) \times  (p,q,r) = \left( \frac{ \partial r}{\partial y} - \frac{ \partial q}{\partial z}, \frac{ \partial p}{\partial z} - \frac{ \partial r}{\partial x}, \frac{ \partial q}{\partial x} - \frac{ \partial p}{\partial y} \right).
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      The divergence of <m>\oa f,</m> denoted by <m>\nabla \cdot \oa f</m>, is a scalar field while the curl of <m>\oa f,</m> denoted by <m>\nabla \times \oa f,</m> is a vector field. If our vector field represents a fluid flow, then the curl of a function at a point is a the direction from that point about which the fluid rotates most rapidly. The points on the ray with base at the point and pointing in the direction of the curl tend not to move, but to spin as the fluid rotates (curls) around that ray.

      <em>Arc Length and Line Integrals over Scalar Fields</em>

          Compute the area of a wall that has as its base the curve <m>c(t) = (t,t^2), \ \ 0 \leq t \leq 1</m> and has a height of <m>t^3</m> at the point <m>(t,t^2).</m>
          EXTRA<fn>This is our introduction to the concept behind the line integral.  Our goal is to compute the area of a wall that has as its base the curve <m>c(t) = (t,t^2), \ \ 0 \leq t \leq 1</m> and has a height  of <m>t^3</m> at the point <m>(t,t^2)</m>. For entertainment's sake, we imagine the scenario where a mathematician lives in a house and likes the neighbor across the street, but does not care for the side neighbor.  Thus she hires our class to build a wall with a parabolic base that has its vertex in her front lawn and curves around her side lawn. The wall is to have height zero in front of her house at the vertex of the parabola and to get cubically taller as it wraps around the side of her house.  We'll need to estimate materials, so we'll need to know the area of the fence. By using a simple, physically possible example, we will see the importance of the arc length in the process.  When we ask what the area of this wall will be, students often say the area trapped between <m>f(x)=x^3</m>, the x-axis, and <m>x=1</m>.  This, however, does not compensate for the curvature of the base of the wall.  Thus, we return to Riemann Sums and compute from first principles. We  partition the base of the wall into <m>N</m> pieces, <m>\{ c(t_0), c(t_1), \dots , c(t_N) \}.</m> Then the area of the wall will simply be the sum of the areas of the sections of the wall, where the <m>i^{th}</m> section of the wall has base the portion of the parabola between <m>c(t_{i-1})</m> and <m>c(t_i)</m> and has approximate height, <m>f(t_i)= t_i^3</m>.  If <m>d</m> represents the formula for the distance between two points in the plane and <m>g(x) = x^2</m>, then an approximation of the area based on this partition would be:
          <md>
            <mrow>area \amp  \approx \amp  \sum_{i=1}^N  d\big( c(t_{i-1}), c(t_i) \big) \ f(t_i)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \amp  \sum_{i=1}^N  d\big( (t_{i-1}, t_{i-1}^2), (t_i, t_i^2) \big) \ f(t_i)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \amp  \sum_{i=1}^N  \sqrt{ ( t_{i} - t_{i-1})^2 +  (t_i^2 - t_{i-1}^2 )^2 } \ f(t_i)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \amp  \sum_{i=1}^N  \sqrt{ 1 +  \frac{(t_i^2 - t_{i-1}^2)^2}{(t_1  - t_{i-1})^2 } } \ f(t_i)  ( t_{i} - t_{i-1})</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \amp  \sum_{i=1}^N  \sqrt{ 1 +  \big(\frac{ g(t_i) - g(t_{i-1}) }{ t_1  - t_{i-1} } \big)^2 } \ f(t_i)  ( t_{i} - t_{i-1})</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  \rightarrow \amp  \int_0^1  \sqrt{ 1 +  g'(t)^2 } \ f(t) \ dt \ \ \ \ \mbox{ as }  n \to \infty</mrow>
          </md>
          Of course, after this derivation, we see that we have simply ended up integrating <m>f(x)=x^3</m> with respect to the arc length of <m>g</m>.  While we have previously shown in this semester and in Calculus II that the arc length of an function <m>g</m> from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> is given by <m>\int_a^b \sqrt{ 1 + g'(x)^2 } \ dx</m>, I think the repetition in the different scenario is valuable.  After the derivation, or in a future class, we discuss other physically admissible examples of scalar integrals <mdash /> integrating the electrical charge of a piece of bent wire in three-space or integrating the density of a piece of wire to obtain the mass.</fn></p>

What would the area of the wall be now? Your answer will be an integral in terms of <m>u</m>, <m>v</m>, and <m>h</m>.

      This is part of a larger theory that we don't have time to cover, but is worth at least discussing. <xref ref="gradient">Problem</xref> and its converse are valid in three dimensions as well. Suppose <m>f: \re^3 \to \re^3</m> is a vector field. If <m>f</m> is conservative, then <m>\nabla \times f = 0.</m> Conversely, if <m>f</m> has continuous first partial derivatives and <m>\nabla \times f = 0</m> then <m>f</m> is conservative. If <m>f:\re^2 \to \re^2</m> and <m>f=(p,q)</m>, then <xref ref="gradient">Problem</xref> showed that if <m>p_y=q_x</m> then <m>f</m> was conservative. If <m>p_y=q_x</m>, then <m>q_x-p_y=0</m> which is the same statement as <m>\nabla \times f \cdot \oa{k} = 0.</m> In summary, understanding the notation <m>\nabla \times f</m> is enough to determine when a vector field is conservative.

      The next two examples remind us that work may be computed by integrating force.
      EXTRA<fn>We use the physics of work and force as the motivation for line integrals over vector fields.  To give an intuition for work, we work the two examples following this note: the work done in stretching a spring and the work done in pumping water out of a cone.  The recurring theme is first principles, the idea of adding up the force required to move one small slice over some distance. To introduce line integrals over vector fields, we sketch a vector field and a curve <m>c</m> passing through the field, considering <m>c(t)</m> as a boat's position at time <m>t</m> as it moves through a turbulent bay with current <m>f(x,y)=(p(x,y),q(x,y))</m> at <m>(x,y)</m>.  We point out that if the direction of the boat <m>c'(t)</m> is perpendicular to the motion of the water <m>f(c(t))</m>, then no work is being done as we are not traveling against a current.  We neglect the wetted surface area, the coefficient of drag and other hydrodynamic factors affecting how much force is required to move the boat through the water. To find the total work associated with the current, we recall the fact that if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are vectors and <m>y</m> is a unit vector then the length of the projection of <m>x</m> onto <m>\{ \lambda y : \lambda \in \re \}</m> is given by <m>x \cdot y</m>.  Therefore, if we make <m>c'(t)</m> a unit vector by dividing by it's magnitude and integrate <m>\dsp f(c(t)) \cdot \frac{c'(t)}{|c'(t)|}</m> with respect to arc length (to accommodate for the length of path), then we have <m>\dsp \int f(c(t)) \cdot \frac{c'(t)}{|c'(t)|} |c'(t)| \ dt</m> and <m>|c'(t)|</m> cancels leaving us with the total work as  <m>\int f(c(t)) \cdot c'(t) \ dt</m>.  We have thus illustrated that sometimes computing work requires writing out the sums and sometimes we may compute the work without resorting to Riemann sums.</fn></p>

Suppose we have a spring that has force <m>f</m> proportional to the square of the distance it is stretched from equilibrium so that <m>f(x)=kx^2</m> (where <m>k>0</m> is the spring's coefficient). If <m>0=x_0 \leq x_1 \leq \dots \leq x_N=4</m>, then the work done to stretch it <m>4 \  units</m> would be

      We now move to the study of vector (force) fields because we would like to be able to compute the total work done by an object as it moves through some field that acts on the object by either aiding or hindering its motion. As examples, think of a metal ball passing through a magnetic field, an electron passing through an electric field, a submarine passing through a fluid field, or a person passing through a gravitational field. Suppose we have an object passing along a curve through a vector field. Let <m>\oa f: \re^2 \to \re^2</m> be our (differentiable) vector field and <m>c: \re \to \re^2</m> be our (differentiable) planar curve or path of the object. Therefore <m>\oa f</m> is of the form, <m>\oa f(x,\ y)=\left(p(x,\ y),\ q(x,\ y)\right)</m> for some <m>p,q: \re^2 \to \re</m> and <m>c</m> is of the form, <m>c(t)=(a(t),\ b(t))</m> for some <m>a, b : \re \to \re.</m> Thus we may compute the work done as the particle moves through the vector field by integrating over the field evaluated at the particle, dotted with the speed of the particle. This gives the component of the force that is acting in the direction of travel of the particle.

      As we will show in a forthcoming lecture, Gauss' Divergence Theorem is equivalent to Green's Theorem. They are simply the same theorem stated in two different ways. Gauss' Divergence Theorem says that if we have a certain simple closed curve representing the boundary of a region over which we have a vector field (a flow), then the flow across boundary (the flux) must equal the integral of the divergence of the fluid (or the electricity or whatever) over the region enclosed by the boundary.
      EXTRA<fn>Rather than proving Gauss' Divergence Theorem, we spend considerable time trying to motivate the physical interpretation, explaining that if we are discussing the movement of particles inside a region via the function <m>f</m> then Gauss' Theorem says that the integral of the divergence of the flow within the region equals the integral of the flow across the boundary of the region.  To put this in context, we give brief lectures on computing the flux (flow across a boundary), the divergence of elementary vector fields, and computing normals to curves.  Then we illustrate with a simple example.

            flow \cdot (unit \ normal \ to \ flow) \cdot width = (3,0) \cdot (1,0) \cdot 2 .
          </me>
          What would be the flow across the line segment from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(2,0)</m>. By logic, it is zero, which is also what we get when we consider the vector computation
          <me>
            (3,0) \cdot (0,-1) \cdot 2.
          </me>
          What if we consider the flow across the line segment from <m>(1,1)</m> to <m>(2,0)</m>?  Using our vector computation,
          <me>
            (3,0) \cdot (\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \cdot \sqrt{2} = 3.
          </me>
          This result makes sense because the flow across the line segment from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(0,1)</m> is also <m>3 ft^3/sec</m> and whatever flows across this line segment must also flow across the line segment from <m>(1,1)</m> to <m>(2,0)</m>.

          DIVERGENCE: Suppose that we have the vector field, <m>\oa f: \re^2 \to \re^2</m> given by <m>\oa f(x,y) = (p(x,y),q(x,y))</m>.

Thus, divergence is a measure of the velocity of the flow.  We sketch vector fields for:

      For both Green's and Gauss' Theorems, when integrating along the boundary of the region the simple closed curve must be positively oriented. That is, you must integrate in a counter-clockwise direction so that the region is on your left as you travel along the parametric curve.

          For the first example we get <m>8\pi</m> one way and <m>-8\pi</m> the other way.  Why?  Because our circle is not positively oriented. The second example reminds us how to integrate by parts!

          While we don't prove either Gauss' or Green's Theorem, we do show that they are equivalent.  We may use the last few minutes of a class period to state the two theorems and reemphasize that they are very similar by reminding them that the line integral associated with Gauss' Theorem has us integrating the component of <m>f</m> that is <em>perpendicular</em> to the boundary, while the line integral associated with Green's Theorem has us integrating the component of <m>f</m> that is <em>parallel</em> to the boundary.  This and starting the theorem by writing the first two lines below may be enough that a student can give the proof the next day.  We conclude the class by saying that if a student has it, then s/he can present it and, if not, then after we present problems the next day, I will present it.  Even if I present it, then I assign as homework for the class to present the other direction, that Green's implies Gauss'. The proof we give follows.
