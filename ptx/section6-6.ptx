  <title>The Hyperbolic Functions</title>
  <p>
    Similar to the trigonometric functions in Euclidean trigonometry, the following functions are important in {{hyperbolic trigonometry}}. These occur in engineering problems because they appear as solutions to differential equations modeling electrical circuits and they can be used to represent the curve that results when hanging a wire between two poles (think telephone lines).
    EXTRA<fn>I often assign this section as homework.  It is not clear to me that it is worth time to do it in class.</fn></p>

        The <term>hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine</term> functions are denoted by <term>sinh</term> and <term>cosh</term> and defined by:
        <me>
          \sinh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2} \mbox{ and }  \cosh(x) = \frac{e^x +e^{-x}}{2}.

      <p>
        The <term>hyperbolic tangent, hyperbolic cotangent, hyperbolic secant, and hyperbolic cosecant</term> functions are denoted by <term>tanh</term>, <term>coth</term>, <term>sech</term>, <term>csch</term> and defined by:
        <me>
          \dsp \tanh(x) = \frac{\sinh(x)}{\cosh(x)}, \;\; \coth(x) = \frac{\cosh(x)}{\sinh(x)}, \;\; \dsp \sech(x) = \frac{1}{\cosh(x)}, \;\; \mbox{ and }  \;\; \dsp \csch(x) = \frac{1}{\sinh(x)}.

    While many inverse functions (such as <m>invtan</m>) cannot be written out explicitly as a function of <m>x</m> only, all of the inverse hyperbolic trigonometric functions can be.
