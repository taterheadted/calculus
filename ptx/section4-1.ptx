    Suppose we have a function <m>f</m> and a point <m>(p,f(p))</m> on <m>f.</m> Suppose <m>L</m> is the tangent line to <m>f</m> at that point. <m>L</m> is the <em>best linear approximation</em> to <m>f</m> at <m>(p,f(p))</m> since <m>f(p) = L(p)</m> and <m>f'(p) = L'(p)</m> and no line can do better than agreeing with <m>f</m> both in the y-coordinate and the derivative. Therefore the tangent line to <m>f</m> at <m>p</m> is often called the best linear approximation or the <em>linearization</em> of <m>f</m> at <m>p.</m>

    Suppose we have an ice cube floating in space that is expanding as cosmic dust forms on its exterior. Suppose the cube has an initial side length of <m>s=3</m> inches and we wish to approximate how much the volume (<m>\dsp V=s^3</m>) will change as the length of the side increases by <m>.1</m> inch. Of course, we can compute the change in volume directly. But we can also approximate it using the fact that the derivative tells us the rate of change of the volume. Recall that
    <me>
      V'(3) \approx \frac{V(3.1) - V(3)}{3.1 - 3}.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    If we think of the change in volume as <m>\Delta V = V(3.1) - V(3)</m> and the change in side length as <m>\Delta s = 3.1 - 3</m>, then
    <me>
      V'(3) \approx \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta s}.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    So,
    <me>
      \Delta V \approx V'(s)  \Delta s = 3(3)^2 * .1 = 2.7
    </me>
    and we expect the volume to change by this amount. In a case where you knew the rate of change of the volume, but did not know a formula for volume you could use this to estimate the change in volume over a small change in side length.

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Compute the exact change in volume of the cube from the previous discussion and compare to our estimate.

        Suppose the radius of a circle <m>C</m> is to be increased from an initial value of 10 by an amount <m>\Delta r = .01</m>. Estimate the corresponding increase in the circle's area (<m>\dsp A=\pi r^2</m>) and compare it to the exact change.

        The surface area of a sphere (<m>S=4\pi r^{2}</m>) is expanding as air is pumped in. Approximate the change in the surface area as the radius expands from <m>r=2.5</m> to <m>r=2.6</m> and compare this to the exact change.
