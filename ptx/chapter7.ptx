      Intuitively speaking, a <em>sequence</em> may be thought of as a list of numbers and a <em>series</em> may be thought of as the sum of a sequence of numbers. The sequence below is approaching <m>0.</m> Does the series below add up to a number, or as we keep adding terms, do the sums tend to infinity?

        \mbox{Series: }  1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + \dots
