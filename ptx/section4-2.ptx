  <title>Limits involving Infinity and Asymptotes</title>
  <p>
    In our original discussion of <m>lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L</m> we required that both <m>a</m> and <m>L</m> be real numbers. We now wish to consider the possibilities where <m>a= \pm \infty</m>. To determine <m>lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)</m> is to ask what is happening to the values of <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> becomes large and positive. One possibility is that <m>f(x)</m> tends toward a real number as <m>x</m> tends toward infinity. In this case we write <m>lim_{x\to \infty} f(x) = L</m> and <m>y=L</m> is a horizontal asymptote. Another possibility is that <m>f(x)</m> grows without bound as <m>x</m> tends to infinity. In this case we write <m>lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = DNE(\infty)</m> to indicate that the limit does not exist but <m>f(x)</m> tends to infinity. <em>A limit does not exist unless it is a real number and infinity is not a number.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Now let's return to the case where <m>a</m> is a real number. It is possible that <m>f(x)</m> grows without bound as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a.</m> In this case we write <m>lim_{x \to a} f(x) = DNE(\infty)</m>. Now we know that the limit does not exist and <m>x=a</m> is a vertical asymptote.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our definition for asymptote will be intuitive, like our definition for limits, because we don't give a mathematically valid explanation of what the word <q>approaches</q> means. Still, it will serve our purposes. A more precise definition might appear in a course titled <q>Real Analysis.</q>
    EXTRA<fn>In what follows, I try to make clear to the students the difference between the intuitive definitions (non-definitions) such as the one for <em>asymptote</em> and the truly mathematically valid definitions, such as the one for <m>lim_{x\to +\infty} f(x)=L</m>.  While I do not expect every student in the class to appreciate the distinction, I am capable of identifying those that strive for the deeper understanding and thus even if I do not test over the precise definitions, by including them I am able to use them as a litmus test for those future mathematicians in the room.   I am honest with the class and tell them, when they ask, which definitions I expect them to know and which ones are really beyond the scope of the course and added for those seeking a bit extra.  When students attempt to treat infinity as a number, I will discuss briefly the extended reals and then refer them to <xref ref="appreal">Appendix</xref></fn>.

        An <term>asymptote</term> of a function <m>f</m> is any curve (or line) that the graph of <m>f</m> approaches.
