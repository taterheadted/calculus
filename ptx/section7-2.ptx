        Bouncing balls.

  </example>

  <p>
    Suppose we drop two balls at the same time from a height of one foot and the first one bounces to the height of one foot with each bounce. (Question for my Mechanical Engineers. Why is it that if you invent this ball, you can retire?) The second ball bounces to half the height that it fell from each time. What distance does each ball travel? Answer:
    <me>
      \mbox{Ball 1:  }  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + \dots
    </me>
    and
    <me>
      \mbox{Ball 2:  }   1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \dots = 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + \dots.
    </me>
  </p>

    Such sums are called <em>series</em> or <em>infinite series</em> and the individual numbers that are added are called the <em>terms</em> of the series. The first sum does not <q>add up,</q> so we'll say it <em>diverges</em>. The second sum does <q>add up,</q> so we'll say it <em>converges</em>. To see that the second sum converges, let
    <me>
      S_1 = 1, \; S_2 = 1 + 1, \; S_3 = 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2}, \; S_4 = 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}, \; \dots
    </me>
    and consider the limit of this new sequence that we have created. The new sequence we have generated, <m>S_1, S_2, S_3, \dots</m> is called the <em>sequence of partial sums</em> of the series and looks like this
    <me>
      S_1 = 1, \; S_2 = 2, \; S_3 = 2\frac{1}{2}, \; S_4 = 2\frac{3}{4},\dots
    </me>

    This notion of adding up partial sums of the series is the motivation for the definition of a series. We say that an infinite series <em>converges</em> if the limit of the partial sums exists.

  <p>
    We are about to develop many theorems (called <q>tests</q>) to tell us if a series converges or diverges. Like the various techniques of integration, each test is easy to apply, but figuring out which test to use on a particular series may be challenging.
  </p>

  <p>
    In our bouncing ball example, you found a formula for the <m>n^{th}</m> partial sum, <m>S_N</m> and showed that <m>\dsp \lim_{N \to \infty} S_N</m> was a real number. Since the sequence of partial sums converged, we say that our series converges. For this example, we were able to write down an exact expression for the <m>N^{th}</m> partial sum and we were able to compute the limit. In many cases, we will be able to determine whether a particular series converges, but not know from the test what it converges to. Knowing that the series converges is valuable, because as long as we <em>know</em> that the it converges then we can use our calculators or computer algebra systems to add enough terms to get as close to the answer as we want.

    In many series problems, it is useful to write out a few terms to see if there is something common that you can factor out
    of the sum. This is trick 49.2.b section 8 from the intergalactic <q>Math Book</q> that they give out when you get your Ph.D.

In the book <q>How to Make Money in Wall Street,</q> Louis Rukeyser wrote something like <q>While it has been stated that money can't buy happiness, I'm confident that you can find other things to spend it on.</q>  Because of this interest, we spend some time talking about investing and how a deep understanding of series is a good start for a career in financial mathematics.  Students (and friends) are often shocked at the interest paid on a house or car note.   Today more than ever, the complex trading algorithms are based on non-trivial mathematics stemming from the fields of calculus, probability and statistics.  As investing is a personal hobby, I can speak with some knowledge about the average mathematical ability of the brokers I have worked with over the years and the need for mathematical literacy in the field.</fn></p>

    The <m>n^{th}</m> term test told us that if the terms don't approach zero, then the series diverges. This does not imply that if the terms do approach zero, then the series converges. The following problem illustrates two important points. First it shows that a series can have terms that approach zero, but still not converge. Second it shows a way to help determine whether a series converges by making a comparison between the series and a closely related integral.

    We now have two types of series for which we can easily determine convergence or divergence: <em>geometric series</em> and <em>p-series</em>. We will use these to determine the convergence or divergence of many other series. If a series with positive terms is less than some convergent series, then it must converge. On the other hand, if a series is larger than a series with positive terms that diverges then it must diverge.

    Consider the series, <m>\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n}{2^n (3n-2)}}.</m> The terms converge to zero, so the <m>n^{th}</m> term test tells us nothing. It is not a geometric series either. It's not obvious what other series we might use the direct comparison test with, although that is a possibility. Still, each term of this series is the product of <m>\dsp{ \frac{1}{2^n}}</m> and <m>\dsp{ \frac{n}{3n-2}}</m> and we know that <m>\dsp \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{3n-2} = \frac{1}{3},</m> so for large values of <m>n,</m> the <m>n^{th}</m> term is approximately equal to <m>\dsp{ \frac{1}{2^n} \cdot \frac{1}{3} }</m>. Hence, our series behaves (for large <m>n</m>) a lot like a geometric series and that's a good intuitive reason to believe it converges. When we have a series like this that <q>looks like</q> a series that we know converges, in this case <m>\dsp \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{2^n}</m>, then if the limit of the ratio of the terms of the two series equals a positive number, then the series either both converge or both diverge. The next theorem makes this precise.

Then the series <m>\displaystyle{\sum_{n=k}^{\infty} a_n}</m> and <m>\displaystyle{\sum_{n=k}^{\infty} b_n}</m> either both converge or both diverge.
