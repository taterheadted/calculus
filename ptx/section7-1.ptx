    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>sequence</term> is a function with domain a subset of the natural numbers and range a subset of the real numbers.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <statement>

        We will denote our sequences by listing elements of the range of the sequence.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\dsp{\frac{1}{2} \;, \frac{1}{4} \; , \frac{1}{8}}\; , \dots</m> denotes the range of the sequence <m>\dsp f(n) = \frac{1}{2^n}, \; n = 1,2,3,\dots</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots</m> denotes the range of the sequence <m>f(n) = a_n, \; n = 1,2,3,\dots</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\dsp \{x_n \}_{n=1}^{\infty}</m> denotes the range of the sequence <m>f(n) = x_n, \; n = 1,2,3,\dots</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\dsp \{x_n=\frac{n}{n+1} \}_{n=1}^{\infty}</m> denotes the range of the sequence <m>\dsp f(n) = \frac{n}{n+1}, \; n = 1,2,3,\dots</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        We mathematicians abuse the definition of function by referring to <m>y=x^3</m> as a function, when in fact the function is the collection of ordered pairs generated by this equation. In a similar abuse, while <m>\{x_n \}_{n=1}^{\infty}</m> or <m>x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots</m> represents the elements of the range of the sequence, we refer to it as though it were the sequence itself.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The sequence <m>\{x_n \}_{n=1}^{\infty}</m> is said to be <term>bounded above</term> if there is number <m>M</m> such that <m>x_n \le M</m> for all <m>n \ge 1</m>. If such a number exists, then <m>M</m> is called an <term>upper bound</term> for the sequence. <term>Bounded below</term> and <term>lower bound</term> are defined in the analogous way. The sequence is <term>bounded</term> if it is bounded above and bounded below.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that the sequence, <m>\dsp \{x_n = \frac{1}{n} \}_{n=1}^{\infty}</m> is bounded above and below.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The sequence <m>\{x_n \}_{n=1}^{\infty}</m> is <term>increasing</term> (often called strictly increasing) if <m>x_n \lt  x_{n+1}</m> for all natural numbers <m>n</m>. The sequence <m>\{x_n \}_{n=1}^{\infty}</m> is <term>non-decreasing</term> if <m>x_n \le x_{n+1}</m> for all natural numbers <m>n</m>. <term>Decreasing</term> and <term>non-increasing</term> are defined similarly. A sequence is said to be <term>monotonic</term> if it is either increasing, decreasing, non-increasing, or non-decreasing.
      </p>
    </statement>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>factorial</term> function is defined for all non-negative integers as follows:

          <li>

              <m>0!=1</m>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>n! = n \cdot (n-1)!</m>   for   <m>n=1,2,3,\dots</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

      0! = 1, \ \ \  1! = 1, \ \ \ 2! = 2 \cdot 1 = 2, \ \ \ 3! = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6, \ \ \ 4! = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 24, \dots

    <statement>
      <p>
        Given a sequence, <m>\{x_n \}_{n=k}^{\infty}</m>, we say that the sequence {{converges}} to the number <m>L</m> if for every positive number <m>\epsilon</m>, there is a natural number <m>N</m> so that for all <m>n \ge N,</m> we have <m>|x_n - L| \lt  \epsilon.</m>

    If <m>\{x_n \}_{n=k}^{\infty}</m> converges to <m>L,</m> we may write <q><m>\displaystyle{\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = L}</m></q> or
    <q><m>\displaystyle{x_n \to L}</m> as <m>n \to \infty.''</m> We call a sequence <em>convergent</em> if there is a number to which it converges, and <em>divergent</em> otherwise. A divergent sequence might tend to <m>\pm \infty</m> or might ``oscillate.</q> In either case, there is no single number that the range of the sequence approaches.

    An <em>axiom</em> is a statement that we use without proof. All of mathematics is built on axioms since one must make certain assumptions just to get started. There are entire branches of mathematics devoted to determining what of the mathematics that we use now would still be true if we changed the underlying axiom system that mathematicians (more or less) universally agree on.

  <p>
    The <em>Completeness Axiom</em> says that if we have a set of numbers and there is some number that is greater than every number in our set, then there must be a <em>smallest</em> number that is greater than or equal to every number in the set.
    EXTRA<fn>To explain the Completeness Axiom, I use a simple tool taken from Gordon Johnson.  Suppose we hold up in our hands an imaginary x-axis and we break it at the number 3.  Where is 3?  Is 3 in the piece of the x-axis that is in our left hand or in our right hand?  Suppose it is in our left hand.  What number does the part of the x-axis in our right hand start at?   This gives an intuitive way to think about the fact that some sets that are bounded above have a maximum element (the part of the axis in our left hand has a largest element). Yet some sets that are bounded below (the part of the axis in our right hand) do not have a minimum element, even though there is a number that is the largest number less than every number in the set.</fn></p>
